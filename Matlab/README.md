## Remarks
##
Image processing toolbox is needed to run this function, function has been tested on MATLAB R2013a on a computer with Windows 7, 64 bits operating system.  The code uses IMOVERLAY function developed by Steven L. Eddins for visualization of detected features. 
The test image is loaded in line #8 in the test_script_PST.m file. The test images can be called from the Test_Images directory and then, set the file name in the code on line #8. 
The images can be color or greyscale. However, PST operation occurs on color images only after converting them to greyscale.

PST function  using MATLAB is developed in Jalali Lab at University of California,  Los Angeles (UCLA).  PST is a spin-off from research on the photonic time stretch technique in Jalali lab at UCLA.  More information about the technique can be found on our group  website: http://www.photonics.ucla.edu
